              <h2>Who I Am</h2>
              <p>
                A junior developer specializing in C# and Java. I'm a problem
                solver who I learns quickly and I am passionate about clean and
                sustainable programming practices like modularization, single
                responsibility, and dependency inversion.
              </p>
              <h2>Where I've been</h2>
              <p>
                I've always been driven by problem solving and puzzles. In the
                Air Force, I was a weather forecaster. Graduated top of my class
                and excelled in the weather model, software centric profession.
                I spent eight years as a sign language interpreter, languages
                are an interest that has translated well to programming.
              </p>
              <h2>What I'm Doing Now</h2>
              <p>
                I'm currently in a Full Stack Java bootcamp with We Can Code IT.
                By graduation I'll be in a really good place to join a company
                as a junior software developer. Ideally, I would join a team and
                with their direction continue to grow and tailor my knowledge to
                my employer's needs.
